# Statistical-Inference-A-B-Testing
This project contains an analysis of an A/B test to evaluate the performance of three marketing campaigns. The dataset is aggregated by LocationID, PromotionID, and week, with further aggregation by LocationID and PromotionID for statistical testing. Pairwise comparisons are conducted to identify the best-performing campaign, addressing the multiple testing problem by using a 99% confidence level for increased accuracy. The analysis includes statistical tests, findings, and actionable recommendations to optimize campaign performance.
